# IITD – Engineering Physics Resource Hub

This repository is a **comprehensive, community-driven resource hub** for students of the **Engineering Physics (EP)** program at **IIT Delhi**.  
It consolidates academic materials, research guidance, career paths, project ideas, and alumni experiences across batches, making it a **single point of reference for EP students**.

The primary objective of this repository is:

> To build a long-term, evolving knowledge base that supports current students and becomes a legacy resource maintained by future batches and the Physics Society of IIT Delhi.

---

## Purpose

This repository aims to assist EP students across all years by providing:

- **Academic course resources** such as notes, past papers, and assignments  
- **Career guidance** in research, core physics, and industry paths  
- **Skill development resources** in mathematics, coding, experimental techniques, and physics  
- **Research opportunities** including labs, fellowships, and university programs  
- **Alumni experiences** from research laboratories, industry roles, and higher education  
- **Project ideas and templates**  
- **Guidance on applications** including SOPs, email templates, and university information
