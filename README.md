This repository is a comprehensive, community-driven resource hub for students of the Engineering Physics (EP) program at IIT Delhi.
It consolidates academic materials, roadmaps, research guidance, career paths, project ideas, and alumni experience across batches — making it a single point of reference for every EP student.

The goal is simple:

To build a long-term, evolving knowledge base that supports current students and becomes a legacy resource maintained by future batches and the Physics Society of IITD.



This repository aims to help EP students across all years by providing:
	•	Academic course resources (notes, past papers, assignments)
	•	Career roadmaps (research, quantum tech, core physics, corporate)
	•	Skill development guidance (coding, math, physics, experimental work)
	•	Research opportunities (labs, fellowships, university programs)
	•	Alumni experiences from research labs, industry roles, higher studies
	•	Project ideas and templates
	•	SOP/email templates for MS/PhD aspirants
