# Faculty Directory – Quantum Technology

This directory contains a **curated, non-exhaustive list of professors and research groups** working in Quantum Technology and closely related areas across universities worldwide.

The purpose of this section is to help students:
- Identify potential PhD advisors (including **direct PhD after BTech**)
- Shortlist faculty for research internships and thesis projects
- Understand global research directions in quantum science and engineering

This is a **starting point**, not a complete database.

## Scope of this directory

Included faculty typically work in one or more of the following areas:
- Quantum computing and algorithms
- Quantum information theory
- Quantum error correction
- Quantum hardware (superconducting, trapped ions, photonics, spins)
- Quantum communication and cryptography
- Quantum sensing and metrology
- Quantum materials and AMO physics

Faculty are grouped **region-wise** for clarity.

## Final note

Choosing a PhD advisor or research mentor is a critical decision.

Use this directory as a **navigation aid**, not a shortcut.  
Depth of understanding and alignment matter far more than the number of emails sent.
