# Physics Skills for Quantum Technology

A strong foundation in physics is essential for almost every career path in Quantum Technology. While the depth required varies by specialization, certain core physics concepts are universally important.

This section outlines **what physics you need, why you need it, and how deep you should go** as a student.

## Core physics areas

### Quantum Mechanics
This is the single most important subject.

Key topics:
- Postulates of quantum mechanics
- State vectors and operators
- Measurement theory
- Time evolution and Hamiltonians
- Two-level systems
- Density matrices (basic familiarity)

Why it matters:
- All quantum technologies are built on quantum mechanics
- Required for algorithms, hardware, communication, and sensing

Depth required:
- Conceptual clarity is essential
- Mathematical rigor increases with research level

### Electromagnetism
Important for hardware, communication, and sensing.

Key topics:
- Maxwell’s equations
- Wave propagation
- Boundary conditions
- Transmission lines
- Resonators and cavities

Why it matters:
- Control and readout of qubits
- Microwave and optical systems
- Signal integrity and noise

---

### Solid-State Physics
Critical for hardware and materials-focused roles.

Key topics:
- Band theory
- Superconductivity
- Semiconductors
- Defects and disorder
- Electron–phonon interactions

Why it matters:
- Understanding qubit platforms
- Materials limitations
- Device performance

---

### Atomic, Molecular, and Optical (AMO) Physics
Essential for trapped ions, neutral atoms, and photonics.

Key topics:
- Atomic energy levels
- Light–matter interaction
- Lasers and cooling
- Optical trapping

Why it matters:
- Quantum communication
- Atomic clocks
- Precision measurement
- Neutral atom and ion-based qubits

---

### Statistical Mechanics
Useful for noise and decoherence analysis.

Key topics:
- Density matrices (thermal states)
- Open quantum systems (introductory level)
- Entropy and temperature

Why it matters:
- Understanding decoherence
- Noise modelling
- Thermal effects in hardware

## How deep should you go?

You do not need mastery of all areas immediately.

Suggested progression:
- Early years: Quantum mechanics + EM
- Mid years: Solid-state or AMO (based on interest)
- Advanced stage: Specialized courses aligned with your track

Depth should increase **as your specialization narrows**.

---

## Recommended learning approach

- Focus on conceptual clarity before advanced mathematics
- Solve problems regularly
- Connect theory to physical systems
- Use simulations to reinforce understanding

Avoid memorizing results without physical intuition.

## How physics maps to career tracks

| Career track | Physics emphasis |
|-------------|------------------|
| Quantum algorithms | Quantum mechanics, math-heavy |
| Quantum software | Quantum mechanics (applied) |
| Quantum hardware | EM, solid-state, AMO |
| Quantum communication | Optics, EM |
| Quantum sensing | AMO, solid-state |
| Quantum materials | Condensed matter |

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Ignoring physics while focusing only on software
- Delaying quantum mechanics too long
- Treating physics as disconnected subjects
- Avoiding experimental exposure entirely

Physics is not optional in quantum technology—it is the foundation.

## Final note

You do not need to be perfect at physics to start in quantum technology.

You need:
- Curiosity
- Consistency
- Willingness to revisit fundamentals

Strong physics skills compound over time and open doors across all quantum career paths.
