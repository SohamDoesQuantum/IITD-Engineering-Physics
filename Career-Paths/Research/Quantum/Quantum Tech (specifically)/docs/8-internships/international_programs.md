## Finding group-specific opportunities

Beyond structured programs:
- Many professors offer direct research internships
- Lab websites often list opportunities
- Cold emailing is common and acceptable

Target alignment is critical.

---

## How to apply effectively

Successful applications typically include:
- Tailored CV
- Focused statement of interest
- Evidence of prior projects
- Clear research motivation

Avoid generic applications.

---

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Applying without understanding the lab’s work
- Missing deadlines
- Weak or generic statements
- Overemphasizing grades alone

Preparation matters more than volume.

---

## Backup strategies

If formal programs don’t work:
- Apply to smaller labs
- Seek remote research roles
- Collaborate on open-source research projects
- Extend local research and aim for future cycles

Persistence pays off.
