# Preface

Quantum Technology is moving from academic curiosity to real-world impact. Advances in quantum computing, quantum communication, sensing, and materials are reshaping how governments, research labs, and technology companies think about the future of computation, security, and precision measurement.

For students—especially those from Engineering Physics and closely related disciplines—this presents a rare opportunity. Few fields allow undergraduates to meaningfully contribute at the intersection of physics, mathematics, engineering, and computer science while the ecosystem itself is still being built.

This guide has been created to help students navigate that opportunity.

## Why this guide exists

Students interested in Quantum Technology often face the same problems:
- Unclear understanding of **what research areas exist**
- Confusion between **academia vs industry paths**
- Lack of clarity on **skills, projects, and qualifications**
- Uncertainty about **internships, higher education, and job roles**
- Scattered resources with no structured roadmap

Most information is either too theoretical, too fragmented, or not career-oriented. This guide aims to consolidate that information into a single, structured, student-friendly resource.

## What this guide is

This repository is a **career-focused roadmap**, not a textbook.

It is designed to:
- Explain the **quantum technology ecosystem**
- Break down **research areas and industry roles**
- Map **skills to careers**
- Provide **year-wise guidance** for undergraduates
- Help students build **projects, CVs, and research profiles**
- Guide decisions around **Masters, PhD, and industry jobs**

The emphasis is on **practical decision-making and long-term career building**.

## Who should use this guide

This guide is primarily written for:
- Engineering Physics students
- Physics, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science students interested in quantum technologies
- Undergraduates exploring research or deep-tech careers
- Students preparing for graduate school or quantum industry roles

No prior expertise in quantum computing is assumed, but curiosity and willingness to learn are essential.

## How to approach this guide

You are not expected to read this guide linearly.

Each section is modular:
- Early-year students should focus on **skills, foundations, and roadmaps**
- Mid-stage students should focus on **research areas, projects, and internships**
- Final-year students should focus on **industry roles, higher education, and applications**

Use this guide as a reference, return to it often, and update your plan as your interests evolve.

## Guiding philosophy

Quantum Technology rewards depth, consistency, and patience.

There are no shortcuts—only compounding effort through:
- Strong fundamentals
- Well-chosen projects
- Research exposure
- Clear communication
- Long-term focus

This guide encourages deliberate preparation over hype, and clarity over confusion.

If used well, it can help you make informed decisions and build a competitive profile for top research labs and quantum technology companies worldwide.
