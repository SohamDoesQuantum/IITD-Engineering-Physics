# Quantum Algorithms

Quantum algorithms study how quantum mechanical principles can be used to solve computational problems more efficiently than classical algorithms.

This area lies at the intersection of **quantum mechanics, mathematics, and computer science**, and is one of the most theory-heavy yet impactful domains in quantum technology.

## What are quantum algorithms?

A quantum algorithm is a sequence of operations (quantum gates and measurements) applied to qubits to compute a desired output.

Unlike classical algorithms, quantum algorithms exploit:
- Superposition
- Entanglement
- Interference
- Measurement-induced collapse

These features enable speedups for specific classes of problems.

- **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**  
  Core subroutine used in many quantum algorithms.

- **Phase Estimation**  
  Central to quantum simulation and eigenvalue problems.

- **Variational Algorithms (VQE, QAOA)**  
  Hybrid quantum–classical algorithms suitable for near-term devices.

## Who should choose this area?

Quantum algorithms may suit you if:
- You enjoy mathematics and abstraction
- You like theoretical reasoning
- You are comfortable with long-term research problems
- You plan to pursue a PhD or research-focused career

Students unsure about heavy theory should explore applied or software-focused quantum tracks first.
