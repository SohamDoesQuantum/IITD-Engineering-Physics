# Quantum Communication and Networks

Quantum Communication focuses on transmitting information using quantum states, typically photons, in a way that enables fundamentally new capabilities—most notably, provably secure communication.

Quantum networks extend this idea to multiple nodes, enabling distributed quantum information processing.

## What is quantum communication?

Quantum communication uses properties of quantum mechanics—such as superposition and entanglement—to encode and transmit information.

A key distinction from classical communication is that **security is guaranteed by physical laws**, not computational assumptions.

## Core components of quantum communication

Key building blocks include:
- Single-photon sources
- Entangled photon pairs
- Quantum channels (optical fibre, free space)
- Detectors and measurement systems

These components must be engineered with extreme precision.

## Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

### What it is
Quantum Key Distribution allows two parties to establish a shared secret key with guaranteed security.

Any eavesdropping attempt necessarily disturbs the quantum states and can be detected.

### Protocols
- BB84
- E91
- Device-independent QKD

QKD is currently the most mature quantum communication technology.

## Quantum networks

Quantum networks aim to connect:
- Quantum computers
- Quantum sensors
- Remote quantum nodes

Key challenges:
- Loss and decoherence over distance
- Entanglement distribution
- Synchronisation
- Scalability

## Quantum repeaters

Quantum repeaters are essential for long-distance quantum communication.

They enable:
- Entanglement swapping
- Error management
- Extension beyond direct transmission limits

Repeater development is an active research area.
