# Quantum Machine Learning (QML)

Quantum Machine Learning explores how quantum computing can be combined with machine learning to improve learning algorithms, optimization, or data processing.

This field sits at the intersection of **quantum computing, classical machine learning, and optimization**, and is one of the most application-oriented quantum research areas.

## What is Quantum Machine Learning?

Quantum Machine Learning investigates:
- How quantum computers can accelerate or enhance ML tasks
- How classical ML can help design and control quantum systems
- Hybrid quantum–classical learning models

Most current QML approaches are hybrid, using classical computers alongside small quantum circuits.

## Key approaches in QML

Common directions include:
- Variational quantum circuits for classification and regression
- Quantum kernels and feature maps
- Quantum-enhanced optimization
- Quantum-inspired classical algorithms
- Using ML for noise mitigation and hardware control

True quantum advantage in ML remains an open research question.

## Why QML is attractive to students

- Lower entry barrier compared to pure theory
- Strong overlap with classical ML skills
- Direct relevance to industry applications
- Easier transition to non-quantum ML roles if needed

This makes QML a popular entry point for students.
