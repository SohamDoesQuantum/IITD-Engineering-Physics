## Why LinkedIn matters in quantum careers

LinkedIn is commonly used to:
- Verify your academic and technical background
- Discover research interns and early-career candidates
- Network with researchers and engineers
- Share technical work and achievements

A clean profile supports applications even when it is not explicitly requested.
