# GitHub Guide for Quantum Technology Students

A well-maintained GitHub profile is one of the strongest signals of seriousness in Quantum Technology. It demonstrates technical skill, consistency, and the ability to document work clearly.

This section explains **how to use GitHub strategically**, not just how to upload code.

## Why GitHub matters in quantum careers

GitHub is used to:
- Share research code
- Collaborate on projects
- Demonstrate programming ability
- Show reproducibility and professionalism

Many recruiters and professors check GitHub before shortlisting candidates.

---

## What your GitHub should show

Your GitHub should demonstrate:
- Clear interest in quantum technology
- Progression from simple to advanced projects
- Clean, readable code
- Proper documentation

A few strong repositories are better than many weak ones.

---

## Recommended repository structure

Each project repository should include:
- `README.md` explaining the project
- Well-organized code folders
- Clear instructions to run the code
- Results and observations
- References to papers or resources used

Treat every repository as a mini-report.

---

## Types of repositories to maintain

### Learning repositories
- Notes and small experiments
- Conceptual explorations
- Practice implementations

### Project repositories
- Complete, focused projects
- Clear problem statements
- Results and analysis

### Contribution repositories
- Forks and pull requests
- Bug fixes or improvements
- Documentation contributions

All three add value when done properly.

---

## Documentation best practices

Good documentation should:
- Explain motivation
- Describe methods
- Present results honestly
- Discuss limitations

Use Markdown effectively and include diagrams where useful.

---

## Version control habits

- Commit frequently with meaningful messages
- Use branches for experiments
- Keep the main branch clean
- Avoid committing large or unnecessary files

Professional habits matter.

---

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Uploading unfinished code without explanation
- Poor or missing README files
- Copy-pasting without understanding
- Treating GitHub as cloud storage

GitHub reflects how you work.

---

## How GitHub helps in applications

For internships and jobs:
- Shows hands-on experience
- Demonstrates coding quality
- Provides talking points in interviews

For graduate school:
- Supports research claims
- Shows independence and initiative
- Strengthens recommendations

---

## Final note

GitHub is not about perfection—it is about **evidence of growth**.

Start early, maintain consistently, and use it as a professional portfolio throughout your quantum career.
