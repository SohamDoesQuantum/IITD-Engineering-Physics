# The Pillars of Quantum Technology

Quantum Technology is not a single discipline. It is an ecosystem composed of multiple interconnected pillars, each with its own goals, tools, and career paths.

Understanding these pillars is essential before choosing a specialization.

## Overview of the four pillars

Quantum Technology can be broadly divided into four major pillars:

1. Quantum Computing  
2. Quantum Communication  
3. Quantum Sensing and Metrology  
4. Quantum Materials and Devices  

Each pillar builds on quantum mechanics but emphasizes different skills and applications.

## 1. Quantum Computing

### What it is
Quantum Computing uses quantum bits (qubits) to perform computations using superposition, entanglement, and interference.

Unlike classical bits, qubits can exist in complex superpositions, enabling new computational paradigms.

### Key focus areas
- Quantum algorithms
- Quantum error correction
- Quantum software and compilers
- Quantum hardware platforms
- Hybrid quantum–classical systems

### Typical backgrounds
- Physics (quantum mechanics)
- Mathematics (linear algebra, probability)
- Computer science (algorithms, complexity)
- Electrical engineering (control, electronics)

### Career roles
- Quantum algorithm researcher
- Quantum software engineer
- Quantum hardware engineer
- Quantum compiler developer

## 2. Quantum Communication

### What it is
Quantum Communication uses quantum states—typically photons—to transmit information securely.

Security is guaranteed by the laws of physics rather than computational assumptions.

### Key focus areas
- Quantum key distribution (QKD)
- Quantum networks
- Quantum repeaters
- Satellite-based quantum links

### Typical backgrounds
- Quantum optics
- Electromagnetism
- Photonics
- Communication systems

### Career roles
- Quantum communication engineer
- Quantum cryptography specialist
- Photonics researcher

## 3. Quantum Sensing and Metrology

### What it is
Quantum Sensing uses quantum effects to measure physical quantities with extremely high precision.

Applications often appear earlier than large-scale quantum computing.

### Key focus areas
- Atomic clocks
- Magnetometry
- Gravimetry
- NV-centre based sensing

### Typical backgrounds
- Atomic and molecular physics
- Solid-state physics
- Optics and lasers
- Experimental techniques

### Career roles
- Quantum sensing engineer
- Experimental physicist
- Instrumentation scientist

## 4. Quantum Materials and Devices

### What it is
This pillar focuses on the materials and devices that make quantum technologies possible.

Without suitable materials, scalable quantum systems cannot exist.

### Key focus areas
- Superconductors
- Semiconductor qubits
- Topological materials
- Fabrication and nanotechnology
- Cryogenics

### Typical backgrounds
- Solid-state physics
- Materials science
- Nanofabrication
- Electrical engineering

### Career roles
- Quantum device physicist
- Materials scientist
- Hardware fabrication engineer

## How the pillars interact

These pillars are deeply interconnected:
- Quantum computing depends on materials and hardware
- Quantum communication relies on photonic devices
- Quantum sensing techniques inform hardware development
- Advances in materials enable all other pillars

Successful quantum professionals often work at the intersection of multiple pillars.

## Choosing a pillar as a student

You do not need to choose immediately.

Early undergraduate years should focus on:
- Strong fundamentals
- Exposure to multiple pillars
- Small exploratory projects

Specialization typically happens in:
- Late undergraduate years
- Masters programs
- Early PhD research

This guide will help you evaluate which pillar aligns best with your interests and strengths.
