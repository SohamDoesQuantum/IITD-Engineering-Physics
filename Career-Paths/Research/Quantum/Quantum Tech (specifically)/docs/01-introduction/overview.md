# Overview of Quantum Technology

Quantum Technology refers to a class of technologies that exploit fundamental quantum mechanical principles—such as superposition, entanglement, and measurement—to perform tasks that are difficult or impossible using classical systems.

Unlike classical technologies, quantum technologies operate at the level of atoms, electrons, photons, and engineered quantum states. This gives rise to entirely new capabilities in computation, communication, sensing, and materials science.

## Why Quantum Technology matters

Quantum Technology is not a speculative field anymore. It is transitioning from laboratory research into real-world systems backed by governments, startups, and large technology companies.

Key reasons it matters:
- Classical computing is reaching physical and energy limits
- Secure communication requires quantum-safe methods
- Precision measurement is critical in science, defence, and medicine
- New materials are essential for energy and electronics
- Nations view quantum technology as a strategic capability

As a result, quantum technology is now a priority area worldwide.

## Major domains of Quantum Technology

Quantum Technology broadly spans four interconnected domains:

1. **Quantum Computing**  
   Uses quantum bits (qubits) to process information in fundamentally new ways.

2. **Quantum Communication**  
   Enables provably secure communication using quantum principles.

3. **Quantum Sensing and Metrology**  
   Uses quantum effects to achieve ultra-precise measurements.

4. **Quantum Materials and Devices**  
   Focuses on materials and hardware that enable quantum systems.

Each domain requires a different combination of physics, mathematics, engineering, and computer science.

## Why Engineering Physics students are well positioned

Engineering Physics students sit at a unique intersection:
- Strong foundations in physics and mathematics
- Exposure to electronics, computation, and experimentation
- Ability to move between theory, software, and hardware

This makes EP students particularly suitable for:
- Quantum research roles
- Quantum hardware and control
- Quantum software and algorithms
- Interdisciplinary quantum startups

Many leading quantum researchers and engineers come from physics-heavy backgrounds similar to Engineering Physics.

## Career relevance

Quantum Technology careers span:
- Academic research (MS/PhD, postdoctoral work)
- Industrial R&D labs
- Quantum software engineering
- Hardware and experimental roles
- Deep-tech startups
- Government and national labs

The skill sets developed for quantum careers—rigorous problem solving, mathematical reasoning, and advanced computation—are also highly transferable.
