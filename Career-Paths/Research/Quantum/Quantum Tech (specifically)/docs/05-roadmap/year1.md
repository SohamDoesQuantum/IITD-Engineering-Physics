# Year 1 Roadmap: Building Foundations

The first year is about **laying strong foundations**. You are not expected to specialize yet. The goal is to build habits, core skills, and early exposure to Quantum Technology without pressure.

---

## Primary goals for Year 1

By the end of Year 1, you should:
- Be comfortable with basic programming
- Have a solid start in mathematics and physics
- Understand what Quantum Technology broadly is
- Start building academic and professional discipline

Depth is not the goal—**consistency is**.

---

## Academics to focus on

### Physics
- Classical mechanics
- Introductory electromagnetism
- Mathematical methods for physics

Focus on:
- Understanding concepts
- Solving problems regularly
- Connecting math with physical intuition

---

### Mathematics
- Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues)
- Calculus (single and multivariable)
- Complex numbers

Linear algebra is especially important—treat it seriously.

---

## Programming foundations

### What to learn
- Python basics
- Control flow, functions, data structures
- Basic NumPy usage

### Why now
- Programming supports every quantum path
- Early exposure makes later work easier

Start using Git and GitHub by the end of the year.

---

## Introduction to Quantum Technology

At this stage:
- Do not dive into advanced quantum mechanics
- Focus on intuition and big-picture understanding

Suggested activities:
- Introductory lectures or videos
- Reading high-level articles
- Attending seminars or talks if available

The goal is familiarity, not mastery.

---

## Projects and exploration

Good beginner activities:
- Small Python projects
- Simple linear algebra simulations
- Visualizing vectors and matrices
- Introductory quantum circuit simulations (optional)

Avoid overambitious projects early.

---

## Extracurricular activities

- Join technical or physics clubs
- Attend workshops or talks
- Participate in beginner hackathons (optional)

Exposure matters more than achievement in Year 1.

---

## What NOT to worry about yet

- Publishing papers
- Choosing a PhD topic
- Advanced quantum algorithms
- Specialization decisions

You have time.

---

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Ignoring fundamentals
- Jumping into advanced topics too early
- Comparing progress with others
- Overloading yourself with resources

Slow and steady progress compounds.

---

## End-of-year checklist

By the end of Year 1, aim to have:
- Comfort with Python basics
- Working knowledge of linear algebra
- Clear understanding of quantum career options
- A GitHub account with at least one small project

---

## Final note

Year 1 sets the tone for your undergraduate journey.

Strong foundations, good habits, and curiosity now will make every later step easier in Quantum Technology.
