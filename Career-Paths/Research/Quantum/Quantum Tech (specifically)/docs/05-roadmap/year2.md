# Year 2 Roadmap: Exploration and Skill Building

The second year is about **structured exploration**. You begin connecting fundamentals to Quantum Technology and start building a profile that can support research internships and meaningful projects.

This is the year where intent starts to matter.

---

## Primary goals for Year 2

By the end of Year 2, you should:
- Have basic exposure to quantum mechanics
- Be comfortable with Python for scientific computing
- Complete your first quantum-related projects
- Identify 1–2 quantum tracks of interest

You are still exploring, but with direction.

---

## Academics to focus on

### Quantum Mechanics
- Postulates of quantum mechanics
- Operators and observables
- Measurement
- Simple two-level systems
- Time evolution

Focus on understanding, not memorization.

---

### Supporting physics
- Electromagnetism (waves, fields)
- Introductory solid-state or modern physics (if available)

These subjects will later support hardware and sensing tracks.

---

### Mathematics
- Deeper linear algebra
- Probability and statistics
- Complex numbers and vector spaces

Aim for fluency, not perfection.

---

## Programming and software

### Strengthen Python
- NumPy, SciPy
- Plotting and visualization
- Writing modular code

### Quantum frameworks
- Learn one framework (Qiskit recommended)
- Build and simulate simple circuits
- Understand measurement outcomes and noise

Start using Jupyter notebooks effectively.

---

## Projects to undertake

Good Year 2 projects include:
- Simulating basic quantum circuits
- Implementing Grover’s or Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm
- Studying noise in small circuits
- Simple VQE experiments
- Linear algebra visualizations

Document all projects clearly on GitHub.

---

## Research exposure

Begin seeking research exposure:
- Talk to professors
- Join a lab as a volunteer
- Apply for summer research programs
- Participate in institute research initiatives

Do not wait until you feel “ready”.

---

## Reading and self-study

- Read introductory quantum computing papers or reviews
- Learn how to skim papers efficiently
- Keep a research notebook or digital log

Focus on understanding motivations and results.

---

## Extracurricular and profile building

- Present small projects if possible
- Attend seminars or conferences
- Start technical writing (blogs or notes)
- Build a professional LinkedIn profile

Visibility starts here.

---

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Staying only in coursework
- Avoiding research due to fear
- Overcommitting to too many tracks
- Neglecting documentation

Consistency matters more than speed.

---

## End-of-year checklist

By the end of Year 2, aim to have:
- Basic quantum mechanics understanding
- At least 2 quantum-related projects
- Familiarity with one quantum SDK
- Initial research or lab exposure
- A clearer sense of preferred tracks

---

## Final note

Year 2 is where quantum careers begin to feel real.

Take initiative, explore actively, and start building tangible evidence of your interest and capability.
